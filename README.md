# swing-slideshow
This was an assignment in our Third-Year Programming module.
The purpose of it was to introduce us to coding GUIs with Swing and the AWT.

We head to create a program which would let the user choose from three different slideshows to view.
We also had to let the user change the background color of each slideshow separately, including if it was a slideshow that was not currently visible.

All of the photographs in the slideshows are public-domain images from https://snappygoat.com.
